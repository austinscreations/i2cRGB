# i2cRGB

I created this custom arduino library to offer control of the PCA9685 Servo / PWM driver. with the use of mosfets you able to control full RGB led lighting strips


Library is Based off the code ADAFruit wrote for the PCA9865

 *  These displays use I2C to communicate, 2 pins are required to interface.

 I've created a few examples of how the code is set up to work, and have a video showing their proper operation. 
 
 In the video I show 2 PCA9685 modules with 7 LEDs as this is something I'm building for someone, and tehy need more than the 5 RGB channels that one PCA9685 can drive
 
 Considering creating custom PCB's for people to use, along with support for RGBW (4 channels per strip) and RGB - color temperature white (5 channels per strip)
